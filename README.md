-- Bruce Eckel, Thinking in C++ Volume 1 (2000)

Basically I needed a project to give me some practice in using C specifically
for working with binary, and decided arbitarily that the best entry level would
be one of the simplest image formats,
[bitmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format). The actual goal of
the program is less clear - I'll get to that once I can correctly read in BMPs.
Maybe I'll combine it with learning some kind of Xorg programming and make an
image viewer, there definitely aren't enough of those.
